Ms. Hirna Patel has experience and education that involves the scientific, medical and governmental communities. Much of her work has been with projects that seek to control and eradicate infectious diseases.

          <p>
          Most recently, she has been employed at the Maricopa County Air Quality Department as a Database Management Assistant.
